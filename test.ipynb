    "2. It searches for Excel files recursively in the current working directory.\n",
    "3. For each file:\n",
    "   a. Attempts to read data from the sheet named \"System Reliability Data\" using the openpyxl engine.\n",
    "   b. Reads additional data from the same sheet, skipping the first 8 rows.\n",
    "   c. Appends values from specific columns to the `sys` and `dat` lists.\n",
    "   d. Extracts a DataFrame containing specific columns from the remaining data and appends it to the `df` list.\n",
    "4. Any exceptions encountered during file processing are caught and ignored.\n",
